## R as a calculator

Remember, you can use R as a calculator. 

```{r}
36/108
```

## Images in RMarkdown

If you want to embed an image into an RMarkdown document, it should be in the same "directory" (folder) as your .Rmd file. So, if you are working on RStudio Cloud, this means the image also needs to be uploaded to RStudio Cloud.

## Tables in RMarkdown

We've seen tables before. If we don't want to embed an image, we can make a probability distribution in a table in RMarkdown.

x    | A | B | C | D
-----|---|---|---|---
p(x) | 0.35  |  0.25  | 0.15  | 0.05

(Knit to see the finished table)

## Trees in RMarkdown

Trees are hard in RMarkdown. If we don't want to embed an image, we can make a tree using TixZ. (Knit to see the finished tree, only works if you Knit to PDF.)
