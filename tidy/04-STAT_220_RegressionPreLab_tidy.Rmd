## Setup and packages

We use three packages in this course: `Lock5Data`, `tidyverse` and `infer`. To load a package, you use the `library()` function, wrapped around the name of a package. I've put the code to load one package into the chunk below. Add the other two you need. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, error = TRUE)
library(Lock5Data)
# put in the other two packages you need here
```

## Loading in data

Let's load the example dataset I have for this course, `GSS_clean.csv`. It should be inside the `data` folder in your RStudio Cloud. We'll use the `read_csv()` function to read in the data. 

```{r data-load}
# this is where data-loading code goes
```

## Data visualization for two quantitative variables

Our main data visualization for two quantitative variables is a scatterplot. 

To make our visualization, we will use the `ggplot()` function, with our data inside, and then use a `+` to add on a `geom_` to tell R what kind of plot we want. In this case, we want a `geom_point()` to make a scatterplot. Inside the `geom_` function, we use the `aes()` function and tell R how to map between  variables in our dataset and variables in the plot. Here's an example:



```{r}
ggplot(GSS) +
  geom_point(aes(x = highest_year_school_completed_spouse, y = highest_year_of_school_completed))
```

As with our plots in the last lab, we get a warning message about missing values being removed. 

Does this plot show a positive association, negative association, or no association? If it shows an association, how strong would you say it is?

## Summary statistics for two quantitative variables

One way to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship is with correlation. To find this, we use the `cor()` function inside our `summarize()` in a data pipeline.  

```{r}
GSS %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(y = highest_year_of_school_completed, 
                              x = highest_year_school_completed_spouse))
```

Much like with our other summary statistics, this gives an `NA` value, because there are `NA` values in one or more of the variables in the dataset. We can use `drop_na()` on those two variables,

```{r}
GSS %>%
  drop_na(highest_year_of_school_completed, highest_year_school_completed_spouse) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(
    y = highest_year_of_school_completed,
    x = highest_year_school_completed_spouse))
```

## Linear models

Another way to study the relationship between two quantitative variables is to fit a linear model. R has a function that does least squares regression, called `lm()` for linear model. This uses the formula syntax, which we're not focusing on in this class. The syntax requires you to write $y~x$ to specify your response and explanatory variable, with a "tilde" in between. (The tilde is up above your Tab key on the keyboard, along with the "tick" ```).  You can run the `lm()` function in your Console or RMarkdown document and get a little information about your model,

```{r}
lm(highest_year_of_school_completed ~ highest_year_school_completed_spouse, data = GSS)
```

but, it's better practice to assign your model object to a name, so you can refer back to it later, and get more information about it. Recall that the assignment operator in R is `<-`. I usually call my models `m1`, `m2`, etc., but you could think of a better name to use (like `schoolmodel` or similar) to remind you what it's about. 

```{r}
m1 <- lm(highest_year_of_school_completed ~ highest_year_school_completed_spouse, data = GSS)
```

When we run this code, nothing prints out. But, a new object should appear in our RStudio Environment pane. Now, we can run R functions on that model object. The most useful one is `summary()`,

```{r}
m1 %>%
  summary()
```

The same model coefficients are shown here, but there is also a lot more information about things like the $R^2$ value. 

### Interpreting coefficients
Let's interpret our model coefficients. Here are the generic sentences I prefer:

**Intercept** If the value of [explanatory variable] was zero, our model would predict [response variable] to be [intercept value].

**Slope** For a one-[unit] increase in [explanatory variable], our model would predict a [slope value]-[unit] [increase/decrease] in [response variable]. 

Let's apply that to this model:




## Predicting values
Models are also useful for prediction. There are more programmatic ways to do prediction in R, but for now I recommend you just use R as a big calculator. Let's see what the model would predict for a person whose spouse had completed 12 years of school (high school):

```{r}

```

Does that make sense?

## Residuals
We are also interested in whether our model overpredicts or underpredicts certain points. We can compute a residual, which is $observed - expected$ or $y_i-\hat{y}_i$. Look at row 21 in the dataset. It represents a 34-year-old person with one child whose spouse completed 12 years of school. What is the observed value of `highest_year_of_school_completed` for this person? What is their residual?

```{r}

```
